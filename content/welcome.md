This is a test page to verify the Quartz sync workflow is working correctly.

## Features Verified

- ✅ Git sync fixed (no more "unrelated histories" error)
- ✅ GitHub Actions deployment working
- ✅ GitHub Pages site live
- ✅ Content publishing workflow operational

## Next Steps

You can now publish content in two ways:

### Method 1: Using Quartz Syncer Plugin

Add `publish: true` to any note's frontmatter in your Obsidian vault,
then use the Quartz Syncer plugin to publish.

### Method 2: Using Quartz CLI

Add markdown files directly to the `content/` directory and
run `npx quartz sync`.
