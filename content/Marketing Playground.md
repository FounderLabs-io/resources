**Use this when:** You need 8+ touchpoints to convert customers (complex products, high consideration purchases, longer sales cycles). This complements [[Your First Funnel]] by showing how to create multiple conversion paths for different awareness levels.

**Don't use this when:** You're validating initial demand or need fast feedback. Start with [[Your First Funnel]] to test if anyone wants what you're building. Use this framework once you've proven demand and need to scale acquisition.

## Why Multiple Touchpoints Matter

Buying behavior has changed. Historical data shows 2-4 touchpoints were sufficient when options were limited. Current research (including Google's buyer journey studies) shows 8-12 touchpoints are now standard for most purchases.

**[[Your First Funnel]] works when:**

- You're testing if anyone wants your product
- You need fast validation feedback
- Customer decision cycle is simple and short
- You're measuring basic acquisition metrics

**This framework applies when:**

- You've validated demand and need to scale
- Your product requires education to understand value
- Multiple stakeholders influence the purchase
- Customers need confidence before committing

The difference: [[Your First Funnel]] tests whether people will buy. This framework scales how many people buy by matching content to their current awareness level.

## The Three Awareness Stages

Customers don't move linearly from discovery to purchase. They spiral through three awareness stages at different speeds:

### 1) Pain Aware

- High awareness of symptoms, low awareness of solutions
- Researching "what's wrong" not "how to fix it"
- Need: Validation that the problem is real and solvable

### 2) Path Aware

- Know the problem exists and that solutions are available
- Researching methodologies, comparing approaches
- Need: Education about which approach works best

### 3) Proof Aware

- Understand the problem and prefer a specific methodology
- Confirming whether a specific product delivers results
- Need: Evidence that your solution produces the outcome

> [!tip] Critical rule:
> 
> Match your content to their current stage. Pushing product features (Proof) to Pain Aware visitors creates resistance. They don't care about your solution until you demonstrate you understand their pain.

---

## Content Types by Awareness Stage

Create assets that match each stage. Pick formats based on your strengths and customer preferences.

### Pain Stage Content Formats

Demonstrate you understand their situation better than they do. Use the Clinical Method for structure.

#### 1) Diagnostic Email Series

- 3-5 emails naming specific symptoms they're experiencing
- Headline: "Are you [specific frustration] despite [effort]?"
- Focus: Why the pain exists and why it's not their fault

#### 2) Problem Assessment

- 10-15 questions categorizing their specific pain
- Returns personalized diagnosis of root cause
- Focus: Help them understand WHY they're experiencing symptoms

#### 3) Community Space

- Private group (Slack/Discord/WhatsApp) around the pain point
- Validates they're not alone in experiencing this
- Focus: Shared experiences, not solutions

#### Clinical Method Structure

Structure all Pain stage content using this four-part framework:

1. **Symptoms** - Observable effects they're experiencing
2. **Causes** - Root reason symptoms occur
3. **Treatments** - Available solution categories
4. **Prognosis** - Realistic timeline for improvement

Apply this to any format: email sequences, articles, videos, assessments.

### Path Stage Content Formats

Educate about your methodology without revealing implementation details that eliminate the need for your product.

#### 1) Methodology Guide

- Written document explaining your complete approach
- Shows the logic of your process without step-by-step execution
- Length: 2000-5000 words or 20-40 minute read

#### 2) Case Study Series

- 3-5 examples of customers applying your methodology
- Structure: Before state → Method applied → Results achieved
- Focus on transformation, not product features

#### 3) Live Training

- 60-90 minute workshop teaching your framework
- Enough depth to understand the approach
- Not enough detail to implement without help

#### 4) Methodology Assessment

- Quiz scoring them on key pillars of your approach
- Returns gap analysis showing strengths/weaknesses
- Reveals where they need the most help

> [!tip] Principle:
> 
> Give away the strategy, sell the implementation. They should leave understanding the framework but still needing assistance to execute.

### Proof Stage Content Formats

Reduce purchase risk by letting them experience the outcome before committing.

#### 1) Sales Conversation

- 30-45 minute diagnostic discussion
- Tailored assessment of their specific situation
- Determines fit between their needs and your solution

#### 2) Trial Period

- 7-14 day product access
- Guided setup ensuring they reach first value
- Time-limited to create urgency

#### 3) Customer Gathering

- Virtual or in-person event with existing customers
- Direct stories from people who've achieved the outcome
- Removes abstraction about what results look like

#### 4) ROI Tool

- Calculator using their specific inputs
- Shows projected return based on their situation
- Quantifies value in their terms

#### 5) Experience Walkthrough

- Video showing exact post-purchase process
- Removes uncertainty about what happens after buying
- Covers weeks 1-4 of customer experience

## Tracking Stage Progression

Measure movement between stages, not just final conversions:

**Pain Stage Metrics:**

- Engagement rate on symptom-focused content
- Assessment completion rate
- Community participation level

**Path Stage Metrics:**

- Guide download and consumption rate
- Workshop attendance and follow-through
- Case study read depth

**Proof Stage Metrics:**

- Sales call booking rate
- Trial activation percentage
- Customer event attendance → conversion rate

Stagnation at a stage indicates misalignment between content and audience needs. If people consume Pain content but don't progress to Path content, your methodology education is missing or unclear.

---

## Common Mistakes

**Pitching Product to Pain Stage Visitors**

Driving traffic to product pages before building understanding. They reject because they don't yet see how your solution connects to their pain. Send traffic to Pain content first.

**Only Creating Path Content**

Your entire marketing is "here's how our methodology works" without first establishing you understand their pain. Path content alone assumes they already trust you.

**Single Content Path**

Offering only one format per stage. Different people prefer different learning styles - some want written guides, others want video, some want interactive assessments.

**Missing Stage Transitions**

Pain content that doesn't point to Path content. Path content that doesn't lead to Proof content. Every piece needs a clear next step.

## Application Example

**Pain Stage:**

- Email series: "The Build-Launch-Crickets Cycle" using Clinical Method
    - Symptoms: Multiple launches with zero customers
    - Causes: Building before validating customer acquisition channels
    - Treatments: Systematic customer discovery frameworks
    - Prognosis: 30 days to conviction, 90 days to first revenue
- Community: Slack channel for pre-PMF founders sharing validation experiments

**Path Stage:**

- Guide: "Company Killer Assumptions Framework" (methodology for identifying and testing critical assumptions)
- Case studies: How cohort members went from analysis paralysis to customer conversations
- Live training: "Your First Validation Experiment" workshop

**Proof Stage:**

- Diagnostic call: 30-minute assessment of runway, current approach, fit for cohort
- ROI tool: "Input your monthly burn and runway → calculate cost of not getting clarity"
- Preview access: Observe one accountability session before committing

Progression: Email series names their exact experience → Guide teaches the validation methodology → Diagnostic call determines if cohort fits their situation.

## Relationship to [[Your First Funnel]]

[[Your First Funnel]] solves a different problem than this framework.

**[[Your First Funnel]] is for demand validation:**

- Testing if anyone will pay for your solution
- Getting fast feedback on product-market fit
- Measuring basic acquisition before you have proven channels
- Understanding which traffic sources produce customers
- Solo founders who need rapid learning cycles

Use [[Your First Funnel]] when you're pre-PMF and need to prove people want what you're building. The goal is speed to truth, not scale.

**Multi-Touch / Marketing Playground Framework is for scaling proven demand:**

- You've validated people will pay
- You're ready to educate larger audiences
- Your product requires multiple touchpoints to understand
- You need content that serves different awareness levels
- You want to reduce sales friction through self-education

Use Multi-Touch Framework after [[Your First Funnel]] proves demand. Now you're optimizing for conversion efficiency across different customer awareness levels.

**Sequential approach:**

1. Build [[Your First Funnel]] to test demand
2. Run traffic, measure conversion, identify bottlenecks
3. Once demand is proven, layer in Multi-Touch content to address awareness gaps
4. Track which stage causes the most drop-off, create content to address it

They work together: [[Your First Funnel]] finds product-market fit. Multi-Touch / Marketing Playground Framework scales it.
