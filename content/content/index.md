# Resources

Frameworks, calculators, templates, and tactics for bootstrapped founders at $0-5k MRR.

No fluff. Just what works.

## How to Use This

You're stuck on something. Find the resource. Do the thing. Move on.

These aren't meant to be read cover-to-cover. Grab what you need when you need it. If you're in PMF or Bust, your weekly commitment should point you to the right resource at the right time.
