# Resources

Frameworks, calculators, templates, and tactics for bootstrapped founders at $0-5k MRR.  Mostly, this is being maintained for those founders who are in the [Founder Labs Community](https://founderlabs.io/community). 

Obviously though, it's public. So, anyone can and should use them.

They were synthesized by [Nate Ritter](https://nateritter.com) based on his experience going from 0 to 1 as a founder.

No fluff. Just what works.

## How to Use This

You're stuck on something. Find the resource. Do the thing. Move on. 

It's not sequential. It's not a course.

These aren't meant to be read cover-to-cover. Grab what you need when you need it. If you're in PMF, Bust, or Pivot accountability program, your cohort and/or facilitator should point you to the right resource at the right time during your weekly commitments.
