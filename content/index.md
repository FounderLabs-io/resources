# Startup Resources

Frameworks, calculators, templates, and tactics for bootstrapped founders at $0-5k MRR.  Mostly, this is being maintained for those founders who are in the [Founder Labs Community](https://founderlabs.io/community). 

Obviously though, it's public. So, anyone can and should use them.

They were synthesized by [Nate Ritter](https://nateritter.com) based on his experience going from 0 to 1 as a founder.

No fluff. Just what works.

## How to Use This

You're stuck on something. Find the resource. Do the thing. Move on. 

It's not sequential. It's not a course.

These aren't meant to be read cover-to-cover. Grab what you need when you need it. If you're in PMF, Bust, or Pivot accountability program, your cohort and/or facilitator should point you to the right resource at the right time during your weekly commitments.

Also, there's a list of [[Suggested Tools]] I use for all my work. 

### The Value Isn't in the Tool - It's in the Review Process

Pre-PMF founders don't need more dashboards or automated tracking. You need a **structured review process** that forces you to look at what's working, what's not, and what to do next.

These frameworks work best when you:
- **Review weekly** (not whenever you remember)
- **Track inputs in the right direction, not just outcomes** (conversations had, not just customers gained)
- **Make one decision per week** based on what the data tells you, this helps you know what to work on

The tools help you see. The weekly review helps you decide. The commitment helps you act.

If you're in the [PMF accountability program](https://founderlabs.io/community), this is built into your weekly check-ins. If you're going solo, block 30 minutes every Friday to review your metrics and pick ONE thing to focus on next week.
